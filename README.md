# Flickr-Browser-App
 Using Flickr API to browse through Flickr from my own Android App

 A very simple app I have made as part of my Android course. The application simply sends a GET request to the Flickr API, with optionals tags that the user can specify, and shows the images that have been parsed out of the JSON response with a RecyclerView. 
 
 Picasso library was used to be able to load and display these images from a link.
